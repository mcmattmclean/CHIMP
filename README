Node & Mongo

Requirements:
- Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows

Getting started:
- Clone repo.
- Run npm install from root directory.
- Run docker-compose up, or docker-compose up -d to run the dameon in the background

Dev Notes:
- Nodemon is running and the app directory is mounted to the container, so there is no need to restart or rebuild the container during development.
- EXCEPT!! If you add a dependency to the package.json file (don't add via npm install), you'll need to run docker-compose up --build to rebuild the image with the new package.
- Stop the containers with docker-compose down.
